# Introduction to Algorithms

This session will cover the concepts used in algorithms, notation, examples of analysis and the difference between time
and memory complexities.

## Complexity

* Complexity is measured in terms of algorithm input.
* Time: Performance on execution, number of computer instructions.
* Memory: Extra memory used for algorithm execution.

| Level | Denomination | Examples & Usages |
| ----- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| O(1) | Constant | An operation, formula |
| O(logN) | Logarithmic | Binary Search |
| O(N) | Linear | Search an element in an Array |
| O(N logN) | Linearithmic | Average complexity in Sorting with Comparisons |
| O(N^2) | Quadratic | Nested for Loop - Bubble Sort |
| O(N^3) | Cubic | Double Nested for Loop - Floyd Warshall |
| O(2^N) | Exponential | Recursive Fibonacci, NP-Hard Problems |

## Sample Problem

Determine the longest multiple of 3 having a set of digits (0-9) of N length.
