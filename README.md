# Algorithms Group - Reloaded Version

Welcome to the new Algorithms study group. This groups meets in Guadalajara,
MÃ©xico, every Tuesday 5.30 PM @ EPAM. The group is not attached to any specific
programming language: We have Java, Kotlin, Scala, Python and Javascript developers as members.

To become a member, please contact Sier [https://github.com/sierisimo], Ernesto [https://github.com/enchf] or Gerardo [https://github.com/luisgerrardo].

## Format

Every session, a topic is discussed, led by one person but open
the participation to all members. The more value added by
brainstorming from the participants is the better. After that,
an analysis forum on a problem start and the goal is to find the
optimal solution in terms of time and memory complexities.

Solutions can be provided in any programming language. It is
preferred to use a branch from master to present a solution.
After the session, admin team will merge solutions into master
to leave evidence of discussions and solutions found, which
could be retaken later in further sessions.
